Statisics Page - MangerDataEntryt

Project Overview:
  
  The Statistics Page is part of the MangerDataEntry project and is designed to collect, store, and process various types of customer data from the final payment page. 
  The data is analyzed based on different criteria, such as price, health funds, insurances, types of services, and cities. The processed data is then saved into an Excel file for easy reporting and further analysis.
  
  This page integrates seamlessly with the rest of the MangerDataEntry system and ensures that all the data is handled efficiently and stored correctly for future reference.

Features:
  Average by Price: Calculate the average amount each customer has paid based on the prices entered during the final payment stage.
  Count Customers by Health Fund: Track how many customers belong to different health funds (e.g., Maccabi, Leumit, Private).
  Classification by Insurances: Classify customers according to their insurance type (e.g., Maccabi Shelley, National, Private).
  Classification by Type of Service: Organize and count the number of customers based on the type of service they received (e.g., specialist doctor, online doctor).
  Classification by Cities: Record and classify how many treatments were performed in each city.
  Data Storage
  All the data is stored in arrays, and these arrays are used to compute the necessary statistics. The results of the calculations are saved into an Excel file for further analysis.
